## Overview of Project

In this project, we've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. We will be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Our responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

### Purpose

The purpose of the school district analysis was to provide data and statistics for students for various types of schools and with varying school funding.  The analysis provides data where conclusions can be drawn regarding funding, type of school and student grades. 

## Resources

-	Data Source: election_results.csv
-	Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.50.1

## Results

**How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:**

 - **Math and reading scores by grade**
	-Replacing the ninth grade scores caused an overall increase in average.
 
- **Scores by school spending**
	- It was found that the overall passing percentage was the highest at 90% when the least amount of money was allocated per student; in this case, the spending range per student of less than $584 saw an overall passing percentage of 90%, while the highest spending range per student saw the lowest overall passing percentage of 54%. The following image demonstrates this finding:

 - **Scores by school size** 
	- The small school size saw a high overall passing percentage while the largest school size saw the lowest overall passing percentage. 

 - **Scores by school type**
	- Charter schools had a high overall passing percentage while District schools saw the lowest overall passing percentage. 

## Summary

Four major changes:
1. Percentage passing Math increased for Thomas High School.
2. Percentage passing Reading increased for Thomas High School.
3. Percentage for Overall Passing increased for Thomas High School.
